Request Personal Voice authorization for macOS Sonoma.

This script uses PyObjC to access the AVFoundation framework and request
Personal Voice permissions, similar to the C++ solution but in Python.

After running this script and granting permission, you can use Personal Voice
with the `say` command like: say -v "YourVoiceName" "Hello world"
