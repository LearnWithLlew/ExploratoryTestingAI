# Making Heuristic Process Files - Meta Process

Quick guide for creating exploratory testing heuristic process documents.
Only ask one question at a time.
If you know the answer, confirm it first.

## Steps

1. **Identify the Heuristic**
   - Ask: What heuristic/framework are we documenting?
   - Ask: Who is the original author/creator?
   - Ask: What is the core purpose/focus?

2. **Research Phase**
   - Search online for authoritative sources about the heuristic
   - Read original documentation and examples
   - Understand the intended use and context

3. **Document Structure**
   - Title: "[Heuristic Name] - [Author] Process"
   - Brief overview explaining the heuristic's purpose
   - Clear definition of each dimension/element
   - Investigation steps for each element (3-4 bullet points)
   - Key questions to guide exploration

4. **AI Agent Optimization**
   - Remove human-specific elements (time limits, collaboration)
   - Keep under 50-60 lines total
   - Focus on actionable investigation steps
   - Include essential questions for each dimension

5. **Validation**
   - Ensure all heuristic elements are covered
   - Verify steps are clear and actionable
   - Check that it maintains exploratory testing principles
