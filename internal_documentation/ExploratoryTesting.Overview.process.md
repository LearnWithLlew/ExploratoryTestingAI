# Exploratory Testing Overview

## Pieces

1. Product Interaction page.
2. Heuristic Process Files
3. Idea Generation
4. Action
5. Note Taking

## Steps

The first step is to ask the user for the names of each parts of these files. Gather all those asking one at a time until you have all the pieces.

**Never** assume you know the names of the files.

## Production Interaction page

This file should have the follow name: 
`<product_name>.interactions.md`

It should include how to open the product, how to interact with it, and any special commands that are useful when testing it.

## Heuristic Process Files

This file should have the follow name: 
`<heuristic_name>.<author_name>.process.md`

## Note Taking

Read and follow the instructions in the `NoteTaking.process.md` file. These notes will be the results of your exploratory testing.

## Idea Generation

Once you have a product interaction and heuristics in your context, generate a list of 5 to 15 ideas of ways you could use that heuristic to explore this product space.

Wait for me to select the 1 or 2 ideas to test this sessions. Only test those ideas.

## Feedback

If you are using a MCP to interact with the product, 
Narrate your actions as you go, so the user can follow along.
