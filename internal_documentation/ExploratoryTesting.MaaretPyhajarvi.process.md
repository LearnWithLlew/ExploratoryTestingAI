# Exploratory Testing Process - Maaret Pyhäjärvi Approach

A collaborative and learning-focused approach to exploratory testing that emphasizes ensemble work, continuous learning, and bridging the gap between manual exploration and automation. The goal is to discover, learn, and improve both the product and the testing process.

## Preparation Phase

### 1. Ensemble Setup
- Form diverse testing ensembles with different perspectives (developer, tester, product owner)
- Establish psychological safety for open discussion of findings
- Set up shared workspace for collaborative exploration
- Define roles: Navigator (guides), Driver (executes), Observers (note-take and suggest)
- Rotate roles regularly to maintain engagement and share knowledge

### 2. Learning Charter
- Define what we want to learn about the system
- Identify knowledge gaps and assumptions to test
- Set exploration boundaries and time constraints
- Focus on building shared understanding of the system
- Plan for knowledge capture and sharing

## Execution Phase

### 3. Collaborative Discovery
- Start with questions rather than predetermined test cases
- Use "strong-style pairing" - ideas from navigator, hands on keyboard for driver
- Think out loud to share mental models and reasoning
- Challenge assumptions through respectful questioning
- Document insights and surprises as they emerge

### 4. Systematic Exploration Techniques
- **Question-Driven Testing**: Start with "What if...?" and "How might...?"
- **Model-Based Exploration**: Build and test mental models of system behavior
- **Persona-Based Testing**: Explore from different user perspectives and contexts
- **Story Testing**: Follow user journeys and narrative flows
- **Constraint Testing**: Identify and test system boundaries and limitations
- **Integration Exploration**: Focus on interfaces and data flow between components

### 5. Learning Amplification
- Pause regularly to reflect on what we've learned
- Share discoveries immediately with the ensemble
- Connect findings to broader system understanding
- Identify patterns and recurring themes
- Plan follow-up explorations based on new insights

## Documentation Phase

While working, record steps, todos and findings in a document called
TestSession.01.md
Figure out the number by incrementing the last number by 1

Focus on capturing:
- Questions that emerged during exploration
- Mental models that were confirmed or challenged
- Surprising behaviors and unexpected discoveries
- Areas that need deeper investigation
- Automation opportunities identified

## Exploration Heuristics

### Ensemble Techniques
- **Mob Testing**: Whole team explores together with shared screen
- **Pair Exploration**: Two people collaborate on testing activities
- **Perspective Rotation**: Switch between user, developer, and business viewpoints
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Teach and learn from each other during exploration
- **Collective Ownership**: Everyone contributes to test design and execution

### Learning-Focused Approaches
- **Assumption Testing**: Explicitly identify and test our assumptions
- **Mental Model Building**: Create and refine understanding of system behavior
- **Pattern Recognition**: Look for consistent behaviors and exceptions
- **Boundary Exploration**: Find edges of functionality and data
- **Integration Investigation**: Understand how components work together

### Automation Integration
- **Exploratory Test Automation**: Use tools to extend human exploration
- **Test Idea Generation**: Let exploration inform automated test creation
- **Rapid Feedback Loops**: Combine manual exploration with automated checks
- **Tool-Assisted Testing**: Use tools to amplify human testing capabilities
- **Documentation Automation**: Capture exploration results for future automation

## Continuous Improvement

### Session Retrospectives
- What did we learn about the product?
- What did we learn about our testing approach?
- What questions emerged that we didn't answer?
- How can we improve our exploration process?
- What should we automate based on our findings?

### Knowledge Management
- Share insights across teams and projects
- Build organizational testing knowledge
- Create reusable exploration templates and charters
- Develop team testing skills and capabilities
- Connect exploration findings to product decisions

## Key Principles

- **Collaboration Over Individual Work**: Testing is a team sport
- **Learning Over Finding**: Focus on understanding, not just bug discovery
- **Questions Over Answers**: Stay curious and keep exploring
- **Adaptation Over Rigid Process**: Adjust approach based on context
- **Integration Over Isolation**: Connect manual exploration with automation
- **Reflection Over Rush**: Take time to understand what we've learned
