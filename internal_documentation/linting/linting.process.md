Read the `.temp/lint-results.txt` file and choose a random issue, and fix that one issue.

Write a git commit message that describes the changes you made to `.temp/commit-message.txt`.

Here's an example of what the commit message should look like:

```
fix(lint): Fixed Issue ST1005 <short_issue_description>
```

**NEVER** turn off linting. Only fix the code to use a better pattern the linter is pointing out.

**NEVER** use voice unless something goes wrong.

If you do not know a better pattern, first, google it, and if that doesn't work, then instead of fixing it, tell me "I don't know how to fix this"
